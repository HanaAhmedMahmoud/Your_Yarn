This project has been 1 year in the making, I started as a prospective computer science student hoping to study an integrated masters in computer science at the University of Nottingham, and have continued after successfully completing my first year. The overall plan is to develop a virtual yarn organiser. I have struggled myself with keeping count on what yarn I have in my collection, so I decided to program an app using XCode and programming in swift to be purchased free of charge from the apple app store. Please see the word document to view the documentation for this project - note that this project is still in development!
